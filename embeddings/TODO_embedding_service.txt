# TODO LIST - EMBEDDING_SERVICE.PY - CURRENT CAPABILITIES
# =============================================================================

# ✅ COMPLETED Jan 20
# - embed_text(): Embed a single piece of text using sentence-transformers
# - embed_all_chunks(): Loop through all chunks, embed each, save results
# - Progress bar with tqdm
# - Saved 14,285 chunks with embeddings to JSON (2:35 runtime on CPU)

# 🔧 ADD LATER (if needed to improve quality):
# - GPU support: Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA for 5-20x speedup
# - Batch embedding: model.encode(list_of_texts) instead of one at a time
# - Caching: Don't re-embed chunks that haven't changed

# 🚀 V2 FEATURES (production-ready):
# - OpenAI embeddings: Higher quality, costs money
# - Cohere embeddings: Alternative provider
# - Rate limiting: Respect API limits
# - Cost tracking: Monitor spend on embedding APIs
# - EmbeddingCache class: Redis-backed cache for embeddings
